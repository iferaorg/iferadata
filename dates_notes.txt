Here are the defined patterns:

P1: Coincident or Near Coincident Dates: first_notice_date is within +/- 1 business day of expiration_date.
P2: Prior Month Notice: first_notice_date is (approximately) the last business day of the calendar month preceding the expiration_date's month.
P3: Post Expiration Notice (Short Delay): first_notice_date is a few (e.g., 2-5) business days after expiration_date.
P4: Next Month or Later Notice (Significant Delay):
P4a: expiration_date is at the end of one month, and first_notice_date is at the end of the next month or a subsequent month.
P4b: first_notice_date is the 1st of the calendar month after the expiration_date's month.
P5: Intra-Month Notice (Not P1):
P5a: first_notice_date is the 1st of expiration_date's month.
P5b: first_notice_date is significantly earlier in expiration_date's month (but not the 1st, and not meeting P1 criteria).
Mixed: The symbol exhibits multiple distinct primary patterns across its history.
Highly Variable/Many Nulls: While a primary pattern might be discernible, the data contains a high number of null values or inconsistent, non-repeating date relationships that make categorization complex.
Here is the list of symbols grouped by their primary pattern category:

P1: Coincident or Near Coincident Dates (first_notice_date is within +/- 1 business day of expiration_date)

AD (Notes: Some historical P3 characteristics)
BP (Notes: Some historical P3 characteristics)
CD
EMD (Notes: Some anomalies matching P5a or P4b)
ES
EU (Notes: Older entries sometimes resemble P3)
GF (Notes: Some anomalies matching P5a)
HE (Notes: Some instances of P3)
JY (Notes: Older entries sometimes resemble P3)
M6A (Notes: When data present; many nulls)
M6E (Notes: When data present; many nulls)
NE (Notes: Older entries sometimes resemble P3)
NQ
PX (Notes: Older entries (pre-2014) showed P3 or had nulls)
QM (Notes: Historically mostly P1; recent entries show P3; many nulls)
RTY (Notes: Older entries have many nulls)
SF (Notes: Older entries (pre-2014) showed P3 variation)
YM (Notes: Some anomalies matching P5a or P4 variants; many nulls in older entries)
P2: Prior Month Notice (first_notice_date is approx. the last business day of the month prior to expiration_date's month)

BO
C
FV
GC
HG
MGC (Notes: Many nulls)
PA
PL
S
SI
SM
TN (Notes: Many nulls, especially in older entries)
TU
TY
UB (Notes: One anomaly (Z11) matched P1)
US (Notes: One anomaly (Z11) matched P3/P4)
W (Notes: Some nulls)
P3: Post Expiration Notice (Short Delay) (first_notice_date is a few business days after expiration_date)

CL (Notes: Some nulls)
HO
NG (Notes: Some nulls)
RB (This pattern is also seen as a secondary or historical characteristic in AD, BP, CD, EU, HE, JY, NE, PX, QM, SF)
P4: Next Month or Later Notice (Significant Delay)

P4a (ED EOM, FND EOM next+ month):
(Seen as part of BZ's mixed characteristics)
P4b (FND 1st of next month):
(Seen as part of VX's mixed characteristics and as anomalies in EMD, YM)
P5: Intra-Month Notice (Not P1)

P5a (FND 1st of ED month):
(Seen as part of VX's mixed characteristics and as anomalies in EMD, GF, YM)
P5b (FND earlier in ED month, not 1st/P1):
LE (This is its dominant characteristic)
Mixed (Multiple distinct primary patterns)

BZ (Exhibits characteristics of P1, P3, and P4a)
VX (Exhibits characteristics of P1, P4b, P5a; generally highly variable with many nulls)
This categorization should provide a clearer understanding of the different behaviors of first_notice_date relative to expiration_date across the analyzed symbols.
